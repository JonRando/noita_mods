# noita_mods
Since the official release of modding support for Noita, I have been tinkering with it a bit.

Here's you'll find any mods I have come up with.  At moment I have just been working on extending the default starter loadouts mod.

So far I have added these new starting loadouts:
Tinker (engineer)
Shadow
Aqua (transmute)
Blood (transmute)

New or unlocked spells:
Sea of Blood
Blood Trail
